The observations that they produce are made available with heterogeneous schemas, vocabularies and data formats, making it difficult to share and reuse this data, for other purposes than those for which they were originally set up. The authors propose an ontology-based approach for providing data access and query capabilities to streaming data sources, allowing users to express their needs at a conceptual level, independent of implementation and language-specific details. In this article, the authors describe the theoretical foundations and technologies that enable exposing semantically enriched sensor metadata, and querying sensor observations through SPARQL extensions, using query rewriting and data translation techniques according to mapping languages, and managing both pull and push delivery modes.", "year": 2012, "publicationDate": null, "authors": [{"authorId": "1795889", "name": "Jean-Paul Calbimonte"}, {"authorId": "34436207", "name": "Hoyoung Jeung"}, {"authorId": "70053552", "name": "\u00d3scar Corcho"}, {"authorId": "1751802", "name": "K.
