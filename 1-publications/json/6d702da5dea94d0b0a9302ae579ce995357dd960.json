As a result, a large number of languages and their associated tools have been created. In this paper, we present the Conceptual Mapping ontology, that is designed to represent the features and characteristics of existing declarative mapping languages to construct Knowledge Graphs. This ontology is built upon the requirements extracted from experts experience, a thorough analysis of the features and capabilities of current mapping languages presented as a comparative framework; and the languages\u2019 limitations discussed by the community and denoted as Mapping Challenges. The ontology is evaluated to ensure that it meets these requirements and has no inconsistencies, pitfalls or modelling errors, and is publicly available online along with its documentation and related resources.", "year": 2022, "publicationDate": "2022-12-29", "authors": [{"authorId": "1485497099", "name": "Ana Iglesias-Molina"}, {"authorId": "3413290", "name": "Andrea Cimmino"}, {"authorId": "1792630", "name": "E.
