Polypharmacy was defined as the use of \u22655 non-HIV medications, and DDIs were classified by a traffic-light ranking for severity. HIV-uninfected controls were also included.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 22,945 patients living with HIV (PLWH) and 6,613,506 uninfected individuals had received medications. Antiretroviral therapy regimens were predominantly based on integrase inhibitors (51.96%). Polypharmacy was significantly higher in PLWH (32.94%) than uninfected individuals (22.16%; P<0.001), and this difference was consistently observed across all age strata except for individuals aged \u226575 years. Polypharmacy was more common in women than men in both PLWH and uninfected individuals. The prevalence of contraindicated combinations involving ARVs was 3.18%. Comedications containing corticosteroids, quetiapine, or antithrombotic agents were associated with the highest risk for red-flag DDI, and the use of raltegravir or dolutegravir-based antiretroviral therapy was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.72 (95% confidence interval: 0.60 - 0.88; P=0.001) for red-flag DDI.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPolypharmacy was more frequent among PLWH across all age groups except those aged \u226575 years and was more common in women. The persistent detection of contraindicated medications in patients receiving ARVs suggests a likely disconnect between hospital and community prescriptions. Switching to alternative unboosted integrase regimens should be considered for patients with high risk of harm from DDIs.", "year": 2020, "publicationDate": "2020-07-11", "authors": [{"authorId": "1413811042", "name": "B.
