Co-medications were classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA total of 6\u00a0636\u00a0451 individuals received medications. Of these individuals, 22\u00a0945 received antiretrovirals (ARVs), and of these 1292 were O-PLWH. Overall, 1135 (87.8%) O-PLWH were taking at least one co-medication, and polypharmacy (at least five co-medications) was observed in 852 individuals (65.9%). A PIM was identified in 482 (37.3%) O-PLWH. Factors independently associated with PIM were polypharmacy [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 7.08; 95% confidence interval (CI) 5.16-9.72] and female sex (aOR 1.75; 95% CI 1.30-2.35). The distribution of PIMs according to ATC drug class were nervous system drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a0369; 28.6%), musculoskeletal system drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a0140; 10.8%), gastrointestinal and metabolism drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a072; 5.6%), cardiovascular drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a061; 4.7%), respiratory system drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a013; 1.0%), antineoplastic and immunomodulating drugs (n\u00a0=\u00a010; 0.8%), and systemic anti-infectives (n\u00a0=\u00a02; 0.2%). Five drugs accounted for 84.8% of the 482O PLWH with PIMs: lorazepam (38.2%), ibuprofen (18.0%), diazepam (10.2%), metoclopramide (9.9%), and zolpidem (8.5%).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nPrescription of PIMs is highly prevalent in O-PLWH. Consistent with data in uninfected elderly people, the most frequently observed PIMs were benzodiazepines and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs . Targeted interventions are warranted to reduce inappropriate prescribing and polypharmacy in this vulnerable population.", "year": 2020, "publicationDate": "2020-06-09", "authors": [{"authorId": "1413811042", "name": "B.
