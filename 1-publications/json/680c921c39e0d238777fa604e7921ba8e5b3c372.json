Several approaches have been developed in this context proposing the storage and querying of RDF data in a distributed fashion, mainly using the MapReduce Programming Model and Hadoop-based ecosystems. New trends in Big Data technologies have also emerged (e.g., Apache Spark, Apache Flink); they use distributed in-memory processing and promise to deliver higher data processing performance. In this paper, we present a formal interpretation of some PACT transformations implemented in the Apache Flink DataSet API. We use this formalization to provide a mapping to translate a SPARQL query to a Flink program. The mapping was implemented in a prototype used to determine the correctness and performance of the solution.
