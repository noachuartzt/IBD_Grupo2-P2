2038383fedccdf0b8c1efcb0832ecd18b481b3c1,Overview of Big Data and Its Visualization,"Big Data is data sets that are so voluminous and complex that traditional data processing application software are inadequate to deal with them. This chapter discusses what Big Data is and its characteristics, and how this information revolution of Big Data is transforming our lives and the new technology and methodologies that have been developed to process data of these huge dimensionalities. This chapter discusses the components of the Big Data stack interface, categories of Big Data analytics software and platforms, descriptions of the top 20 Big Data analytics software. Big Data visualization techniques are discussed with real data from fatality analysis reporting system (FARS) managed by National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) of the United States Department of Transportation. Big Data web-based visualization software are discussed that are both JavaScript-based and user-interface-based. This chapter also discusses the challenges and opportunities of using Big Data and presents a flow diagram of the 30 chapters within this handbook.",2022,,"3128073,2052804160","R. Segall,G. Niu"

The goal of artificial intelligence in the medical field is to assist doctors and health care workers in diagnosing diseases and clinical treatment, reducing the rate of medical error, and saving lives of citizens. The main and widely used technologies are expert systems, machine learning and big data. In the article, a brief overview of the three mentioned techniques will be provided to make it easier for readers to understand these techniques and their importance.",2022,2022-03-01,"1394846990,2149322954,21366673,2061630849,2156915219","Maad M.

7dee9f8f534df0cbb38b12d3bb7c84f86c704fd0,Skin Cancer Diagnosis Using an Improved Ensemble Machine Learning model,"In recent years skin cancer is becoming more and more threatening because of its fast and significant spread worldwide. This evidence has increased interest and efforts in the development of automatic diagnostic computational systems to assist early diagnosis. Several approaches have been proposed to assist in skin lesion diagnosis which used machine learning and ensemble learning. In some cases, a classifier can correctly predict the output class while others fail and vice versa. So the idea is to use different machine learning and ensemble learning to classify skin cancer. In this paper, we propose an improved ensemble learning method to classify skin cancer. Features used are the best combination of extracted features from different characteristics, i.e., shape, color, texture, and skeleton of the lesion, then we classify these features using different algorithms to predict the classes. Globally, the experimented results show a promoting result.",2020,2020-06-01,"8656345,21366673,41032793,143637629","M. A. Sabri,Y. Filali,Hasnae El Khoukhi,A. Aarab"

Among them, the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19) has proven to be a valuable resource that provides full-text articles from the PubMed Central, bioRxiv and medRxiv repositories. Such a large amount of biomedical literature needs to be properly managed to facilitate and promote its use by health professionals, for example by tagging documents with the biomedical entities that appear on them. We created a biomedical named entity recognizer (NER) that normalizes (NEN) the drugs, diseases, genes and proteins mentioned in texts with the codes of the main standardization systems such as MeSH, ICD-10, ATC, SNOMED, ChEBI, GARD and NCBI. It is based on fine-tuning the BioBERT language model independently for each entity type using domain-specific datasets and an inverse index search to normalize the references. We have used the resultant BioNER+BioNEN system to process the CORD-19 corpus and offer an overview of the drugs, diseases, genes and proteins related to coronaviruses in the last fifty years.",2022,,"2134990618,2072861538,70053552","Carlos Badenes-Olmedo,Álvaro Alonso,Óscar Corcho"

Biomarkers indicating potential clinical utility that reliably reflect the degree of fibrosis have been introduced, one of them being soluble suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (sST2). The aim of our study was to explore the association of cardiometabolic risk factors, different diseases and total mortality with biomarker sST2 and see, how fibrosis is portrayed in these conditions. In addition, we were interested to see if sST2 levels could predict fibrosis in the long-term (21 years). The Oulu Project Elucidating Risk of Atherosclerosis (OPERA) survey collected data on the same individuals in years 1991–1993 (baseline, n = 1045), 2013–2014 (follow-up, n = 600) and mortality data until year 2019. Smoking at baseline retained a significant association with sST2 levels reflecting fibrosis development 20 years later. In the multivariate model male gender, diabetes, quick-index, levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were associated with elevated sST2 levels at the examination 2013–2014. sST2 levels were higher among subjects suffering from cardiovascular disease (p = .031), cancer (p = .021), mild cognitive decline (p = .046) and diabetes (p < .001). Total mortality was assessed by using the Cox proportional hazard survival model analysis. sST2 (log-transformed) was an independent predictor of total mortality (HR 9.4; 95% CI 2.8–31.4, p<.001) when age, gender, diabetes, smoking, quick-index, levels of ALAT, HDL-cholesterol and hsCRP were added as covariates. In addition, elevated levels indicated worse prognosis and predicted mortality.",2021,2021-04-01,"2062736880,3550608,5452890","Y. Filali,Y. Kesäniemi,O. Ukkola"
